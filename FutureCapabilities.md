# Future Capabilities and Gaps

1) Web browsing/full fetch (beyond SerpAPI search): follow links, fetch page content, summarize with citations.
2) RAG enhancements: rerank, metadata filters, per-repo indexes, citations, and multi-index management.
3) Safety: allow/deny lists for shell/SSH, secret redaction, approvals for risky ops, undo/trash or journal for destructive actions.
4) Code intelligence: lint/format/test runners, repo-wide code search/summarize, diff/apply-patch guardrails, coverage/type checks.
5) Memory: per-workspace long-term memory or profile injection; session summaries; configurable personas.
6) Install/tooling: broader package management helpers (pip/npm), tool marketplace; better handling of missing deps.
7) Planner/executor: multi-step planning with verification loops; retry/fallback strategies.
8) SSH improvements: agent forwarding, host key management, per-host profiles, SSH over jump hosts.
9) File transfer: upload/download helpers (S3/http), archiving/compression.
10) Environment insights: richer OS/hardware/software inventory tools.
11) CI/tests: automated checks, lint/format hooks, test runners integrated into commands.
